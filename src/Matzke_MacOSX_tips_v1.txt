NOTES ON INSTALLING FAMSA AND FAMSA3DI ON A MAC LAPTOP

I. Updating compilers and installing famsa
* Had to go to the Apple website and download Xcode 13.4, the latest compatible with OSX 12.4
* 10 GB zipfile, installs to 35 GB Xcode.app (!!) drag into /Applications
* Also had to install Xcode Developer Tools for Xcode 13.4, <1 GB install
* Once these were all done, the makefile for famsa and famsa3di worked fine.
  - (I had to make sure the .o and .so files were deleted first)
  - famsa3di source code, without .o and .so files, is at: /GitHub/str2phy/src/

(Yes, it's absurd that it takes 40 GB of installations to get the little famsa program working, but that's computers for you)

The command to install famsa3di was just:

manually copy FAMSA_3di-2.2.2 from GitHub to /Downloads/FAMSA_3di-2.2.2
cd /Downloads/FAMSA_3di-2.2.2
make

# test it locally:
./famsa3di

# Copy it to universally usable location
sudo cp famsa3di /usr/local/bin/

# Open a new terminal, type
which famsa3di
famsa3di


II. Getting simple symbolic paths on the laptop:

Since my code often refers to files on GitHub and the like, I want all my machines (and yours!) to be
able to refer to the same file paths on your machines.

I also want these file paths to be fairly short.  E.g.,

Good: ~/GitHub/str2phy/Rsrc/str2phy_v1.R
Bad:  /Systems/Volumes/Data/GitHub/str2phy/Rsrc/str2phy_v1.R

The simplest way to do this is to put your GitHub local repository in your default user directory (represented by "~"),
or create a symbolic link (see below) in your user directory to wherever you have stored your GitHub local repository.



III. Command-line shortcut for ChimeraX

Once you have ChimeraX downloaded and running, you can make a shortcut to run it from the Command-line:

cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s /Applications/ChimeraX-1.7.1.app/Contents/bin/ChimeraX chimerax 
ln -s /Applications/ChimeraX-1.7.1.app/Contents/bin/ChimeraX chimx   
ln -s /Applications/ChimeraX-1.7.1.app/Contents/bin/ChimeraX cx 

Similar shortcuts should be done for e.g. famsa3di, foldseek, etc. (unless those programs have already been copied to /usr/local/bin/)
